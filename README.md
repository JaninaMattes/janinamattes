### Hi there and welcome to my GitHub page 👋

My name is Janina and I am a master's student of Computer Science at the University of Munich. My focus lies in **machine learning**, **VR and game development** and I am currently learning about **high-performance computing**. I have a passion for robotics, science, learning and sharing my knowledge with others. You can see a full list of what I am up to on my [projects & portfolio](https://janinamattes.github.io/#profile) (currently a work in progress ⏳).
