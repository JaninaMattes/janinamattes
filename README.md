### Hi there and welcome to my GitHub page ðŸ‘‹

I am currently focusing on <strong>Machine Learning</strong>, specifically the <a href="https://github.com/NAME/document-layout-analysis-backend/tree/main" style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">document-layout-analysis-backend</a> project. I am also working on <strong>VR and Game Development with Unreal and Unity</strong>, and you can check out my <a href="https://github.com/NAME/robotics-vr-game" style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">robotics-vr-game</a> project for more details. In addition, I am learning more about <strong>High Performance Computing</strong> through the <a href="https://github.com/NAME/High-Performance-Computing-Exercises" style="color: black; text-decoration: none;">High-Performance-Computing-Exercises</a> repository.


My name is Janina and I am a master's student of Computer Science at the University of Munich. My focus lies in [**machine learning**](https://github.com/JaninaMattes/document-layout-analysis-backend/tree/main), [VR game development](https://github.com/JaninaMattes/robotics-vr-game) and I am currently learning about [high-performance computing](https://github.com/JaninaMattes/High-Performance-Computing-Exercises). I have a passion for robotics, science, learning and sharing my knowledge with others. You can see a full list of what I am up to on my [projects & portfolio](https://janinamattes.github.io/#profile) (currently a work in progress).
