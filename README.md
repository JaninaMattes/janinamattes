### Hi there 👋 I’m Janina

I’m a Master’s student in Computer Science at :contentReference[oaicite:0]{index=0}, with a strong interest in building intelligent and interactive systems.
My main focus areas are **machine learning**, **full-stack development** (web & mobile), and **VR/game development**. I’m currently expanding my skill set in **high-performance computing** to better understand scalable and efficient systems.

I’m passionate about robotics, science, and continuous learning—and I enjoy sharing what I learn along the way.  
You can find an overview of my work, experiments, and ongoing projects in my **[projects & portfolio](https://janinamattes.github.io/#profile)** (work in progress ⏳).

**What do I do?**

- 🔭 I’m currently (and constantly) working on my [personal website](https://janinamattes.github.io/#profile)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about autonomous driving and EKF SLAM with [ROS 2](https://github.com/munichmotorsport) and how to solve drone flight with [Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/JaninaMattes/Autonomous-Explorer-Drone). I'm always trying to find better solutions to my project ideas.
