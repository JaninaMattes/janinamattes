### Hi there and welcome to my GitHub page 👋

My name is Janina and I am a master's student of Computer Science at the University of Munich. My focus lies in **machine learning**, **VR and game development** and I am currently learning about **high-performance computing**. I have a passion for robotics, science, learning and sharing my knowledge with others. You can see a full list of what I am up to on my [projects & portfolio](https://janinamattes.github.io/#profile) (currently a work in progress ⏳).

**What do I do?**

- 🔭 I’m currently (and constantly) working on my [personal website](https://janinamattes.github.io/#profile)
- 🌱 I’m currently learning more about autonomous driving with [ROS 2](https://github.com/munichmotorsport), and solving autonomous drone flight with [Reinforcement Learning](https://github.com/JaninaMattes/Autonomous-Explorer-Drone). I'm always trying to find better solutions to my project ideas.
